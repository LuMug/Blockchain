Peer Discovery:
The seed must contain a list of the last 1000 ip's (and also the port) active on the blockchain.
If a machine wants to connect to the blockchain for the first time, it must first ask a seed for 100 random ip's
that the seed believes are active. Once these ip's are saved in the appropriate table in the local database,
the machine can start to search for a node on the blockchain, using the saved ip's.
When it finds an active node it asks for the ip it knows, at this point the machine becomes
a node of the blockchain that can communicate with other nodes.
Alive status:
Every 5 min both between nodes themselves and between node and seed, there is a communication from the node,
which notifies its state of alive on the blockchain.

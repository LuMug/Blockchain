I am quite pleased with the way this project was done. This was the first time I have tackled such a project and all of the
knowledge necessary for its implementation was unknown to me at first. However, I think that as a group we performed
pretty well, even considering all the unforeseen events we faced. I knew it was going to be a pretty complicated project
and doing it in two people didn't help, moreover, my project partner was Paolo and I found myself very often in difficulty trying to
keep up with his explanations and reasoning.
